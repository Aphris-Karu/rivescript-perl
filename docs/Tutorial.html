<p>RiveScript::Tutorial - Learn to write RiveScript code.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
<p>This tutorial will help you learn how to write your own chatbot personalities
using the RiveScript language.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="getting_started">Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>To <strong>write</strong> your own RiveScript code, you will only need a simple text editing
program. You can use Notepad for Windows, or gedit for Linux, or any other
text editors you have available.</p>
<p>A RiveScript document is a text file containing RiveScript code. These files
will have a <code>.rs</code> extension. An example file name would be <code>greetings.rs</code>.
If you're writing RiveScript documents on Windows, you may need to put the
file name in quotes when you save it, for example <code>&quot;greetings.rs&quot;</code> to be
sure it gets saved with the file extension (and not &quot;<code>greetings.rs.txt</code>&quot;).</p>
<p>To <strong>execute</strong> and test your RiveScript code, you will need a RiveScript
Interpreter, or, a program that uses a RiveScript library to read and execute
RiveScript code.</p>
<p>The Perl <em>RiveScript</em> module comes with a ready-to-use interpreter that can
be used for this tutorial! If you've installed the Perl RiveScript module on
a Linux, Unix or Mac OS system, the RiveScript interpreter will probably be
installed in a place like <code>/usr/bin/rivescript</code> or
<code>/usr/local/bin/rivescript</code>. You can open a terminal window and run the
command &quot;<code>rivescript</code>&quot; to use the RiveScript interpreter.</p>
<p>If you're using Windows, or the <code>rivescript</code> command wasn't installed, you
can obtain it from the distribution from CPAN, in the &quot;bin&quot; directory. After
installing RiveScript, you can run the <code>rivescript</code> program in a terminal or
command prompt window by switching to the &quot;bin&quot; directory and typing
&quot;<code>perl rivescript</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>If you are able to run the RiveScript interpreter that is shipped with the
Perl distribution, you will be able to continue with this tutorial. If you're
using a different RiveScript library, such as the Python version, please refer
to the documentation of the library to see if it comes with a RiveScript
interpreter that you can use.</p>
<p>If you need to write your own interpreter program, see
<a href="#writing_an_interpreter">Writing an Interpreter</a> for an example of how to do this in Perl.</p>
<p>This tutorial will assume you are using the <code>rivescript</code> command shipped
with the Perl RiveScript library.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="project_directory">Project Directory</a></h2>
<p>For this tutorial, you should create a folder to save your RiveScript documents
to. The following are some recommended locations, but you can place them
wherever you like.</p>
<p>For Linux, Unix and Mac OS users, I recommend making a folder in your home
directory, like so:</p>
<pre>
  Unix: /home/USER/rstut
  Mac:  /Users/USER/rstut</pre>
<p>Substitute <code>USER</code> with your username of course.</p>
<p>For Windows users, make a directory in the <code>C:\</code> drive, like so:</p>
<pre>
  Windows: C:\rstut</pre>
<p>After you begin writing RiveScript documents, you can test your code at any time
by running the RiveScript interpreter and pointing it at your reply directory.</p>
<p>For Linux, Unix and Mac OS users, open a terminal window and run a command such
as the following:</p>
<pre>
  rivescript rstut</pre>
<p>For Windows, open a command prompt window (push the Start button, type <code>cmd</code>
and hit Enter. For Windows XP or older, push the Windows key + R on your
keyboard, and type <code>cmd</code> and hit enter in the Run dialog). Navigate to the
&quot;bin&quot; folder in the Perl RiveScript distribution by using the <code>cd</code> command,
and then run the following command:</p>
<pre>
  perl rivescript C:/rstut</pre>
<p>If you're having trouble getting this to work on Windows, see
<a href="#windows_troubleshooting">Windows Troubleshooting</a> for help.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="first_steps">FIRST STEPS</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="hello__human_">Hello, Human!</a></h2>
<p>Let's write our first few lines of RiveScript code!</p>
<p>In your text editor, create a new file and write the following in it:</p>
<pre>
  ! version = 2.0</pre>
<pre>
  + hello bot
  - Hello, human!</pre>
<p>Save this in your project directory as <code>hello.rs</code>, and then run the RiveScript
interpreter on that directory (see <a href="#project_directory">Project Directory</a> for reference). You
should see something along these lines in your terminal window:</p>
<pre>
  RiveScript Interpreter - Interactive Mode
  -----------------------------------------
  RiveScript Version: 1.28
          Reply Root: rstut</pre>
<pre>
  You are now chatting with the RiveScript bot. Type a message and press
  Return to send it.
  When finished, type '/quit' to exit the program. Type '/help' for other
  options.</pre>
<pre>
  You&gt;</pre>
<p>At the prompt, type &quot;Hello bot&quot; and press Enter. The bot should respond with
&quot;Hello, human!&quot;</p>
<p>Try saying something else to the bot, such as &quot;how are you?&quot; and see what
it says. The bot should respond with, &quot;ERR: No Reply Matched&quot;. This is because
you said something that there was no RiveScript code written to handle. There
is only a handler for &quot;hello bot&quot;, and nothing else. Later you will learn how
to write a &quot;catch-all&quot; response that will be used when you say something the
bot wasn't programmed to handle. But first, let's go over the code you wrote
for <code>hello.rs</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="the_code__explained">The Code, Explained</a></h3>
<p>RiveScript code is really simple. Each line of the text file is a separate
entity (RiveScript is a line-based scripting language). Lines of RiveScript
code always begin with a command symbol (in this example, the symbols we see
are <code>!</code>, <code>+</code>, and <code>-</code>) and they always have some kind of data that follows
them. The data depends on the command used.</p>
<p>The line, &quot;<code>! version = 2.0</code>&quot; tells the RiveScript interpreter that your code
follows version 2.0 of the RiveScript specification. This way, future versions
of the language can be backwards compatible with existing code by looking at
the version number and responding accordingly. It is a good idea to always
include the version line in your code (but it isn't the end of the world if you
leave it out -- you'll just leave the interpreter to make its best guess about
which version your code is using).</p>
<p>The <code>+</code> command is how you define a <strong>trigger</strong>. A trigger is a line of text
that is used to match the user's message. In this case, &quot;hello world&quot; is
exactly the message that we're matching. You will learn about some more
complex features of triggers later in this tutorial.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> a trigger is ALWAYS lower cased, and it doesn't contain
punctuation symbols. Even if you write a trigger that contains the proper noun
&quot;I&quot;, that &quot;I&quot; should be lowercased too. You may have noticed when testing your
code that the interpreter doesn't care about the capitalizations used in your
messages: you can say &quot;Hello Bot&quot;, &quot;HELLO BOT&quot;, or &quot;hello bot&quot; and it will
match the trigger all the same.</p>
<p>The <code>-</code> command is how you define a response to a trigger. In this case,
when the user matches the &quot;hello bot&quot; trigger, the bot should respond to
the user by saying &quot;Hello, human!&quot;</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="random_replies">Random Replies</a></h2>
<p>Making your bot <em>always</em> respond exactly the same way to something the user
says will get boring really quickly. For this reason, RiveScript makes it
easy to add random responses to a trigger!</p>
<p>Getting random responses is as easy as entering multiple Response commands
for the same trigger. To see this in action, open your <code>hello.rs</code> file from
<a href="#hello__human_">Hello, Human!</a> and add the following lines to it:</p>
<pre>
  + how are you
  - I'm great, how are you?
  - I'm good, you?
  - Good :) you?
  - Great! You?
  - I'm fine, thanks for asking!</pre>
<p>Save this and then test it with the RiveScript interpreter. Ask your bot,
&quot;How are you?&quot; a few times and see how it responds. It will say one of these
five things at random each time you ask!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="a_note_about_style">A Note About Style</a></h3>
<p>To keep your RiveScript documents nice and tidy and easy to read (and
maintain!) you should follow these style guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="use_blank_lines_to_separate_logical_groups_of_code" class="item">Use blank lines to separate logical groups of code.</a></strong>

<p>For example, a trigger line and its responses should be grouped together,
and a blank line should separate them from a different trigger and its
responses.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="indent_code_inside_a_topic_or_begin_block" class="item">Indent code inside a topic or begin block.</a></strong>

<p>You'll learn about these later in this tutorial.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, our <code>hello.rs</code> should look like this now:</p>
<pre>
  ! version = 2.0</pre>
<pre>
  + hello bot
  - Hello, human!</pre>
<pre>
  + how are you
  - I'm great, how are you?
  - I'm good, you?
  - Good :) you?
  - Great! You?
  - I'm fine, thanks for asking!</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="let_s_talk_about_weight">Let's Talk About Weight</a></h3>
<p>While random responses are certainly useful, there will be times when you
would prefer that <em>some</em> replies would be chosen more frequently than
others. For example, you might be writing a bot whose personality is that
he's secretly an alien pretending to be a human that's pretending to be a
bot, and you want the bot to respond in some unintelligible gibberish
every once in a while.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>{weight}</code> tag in a reply to override how frequently that
reply will be chosen compared to the others. For our alien gibberish example,
you could write a reply like this:</p>
<pre>
  + greetings
  - Hi there!{weight=20}
  - Hello!{weight=25}
  - Yos kyoco duckeb!</pre>
<p>Here, we've assigned a weight to each of the English responses, and
left the gibberish one alone. The effect that this has is that &quot;Hi there!&quot;
will be picked 20 times out of 46, &quot;Hello!&quot; will be picked 25 times out of
46, and &quot;Yos kyoco duckeb!&quot; will be chosen only 1 time out of 46.</p>
<p>You can test this by saying &quot;greetings&quot; to your bot over and over again.
It should <em>very rarely</em> choose the &quot;Yos kyoco duckeb!&quot; response compared
to the other two.</p>
<p>The weight value controls the probability that the reply is chosen. Replies
that don't explicitly include a weight tag automatically have a weight of 1.
The probability of each reply being chosen is the reply's weight divided by
the sum of all the weights combined (in this example, 20 + 25 + 1 = 46, so
each reply has its weight out of 46 chance of being chosen).</p>
<p>Weight values can't be zero and they can't be negative.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="the_begin_file">The Begin File</a></h2>
<p>You now know some of the basics about how triggers and replies relate to
each other. Before continuing, you should know how RiveScript brains are
typically organized.</p>
<p>RiveScript brains (a &quot;brain&quot; is a set of RiveScript documents) should, by
convention, include a document named <code>begin.rs</code> that contains some
configuration settings for your bot's brain. The most useful settings that
would be set here include <strong>substitutions</strong>, which are able to make changes
to the user's message <em>before</em> a reply is looked for.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that the RiveScript interpreter doesn't care about
punctuation in your messages (you can say &quot;Hello bot!!!&quot; and it ignores the
exclamation marks), so what does that mean for things such as the word &quot;what's&quot;?
By default, the word &quot;what's&quot; would be converted into &quot;whats&quot; before the
interpreter looks for a reply for it. With substitutions, you can see to it
that &quot;what's&quot; is expanded into &quot;what is&quot; instead -- allowing you better
control over how you reply to the user's message!</p>
<p>Let's start with our <code>begin.rs</code> file. In your text editor, create a new
document and write the following code into it (this code will be explained
below):</p>
<pre>
  ! version = 2.0</pre>
<pre>
  // Bot variables
  ! var name = Tutorial
  ! var age  = 5</pre>
<pre>
  // Substitutions
  ! sub i'm     = i am
  ! sub i'd     = i would
  ! sub i've    = i have
  ! sub i'll    = i will
  ! sub don't   = do not
  ! sub isn't   = is not
  ! sub you'd   = you would
  ! sub you're  = you are
  ! sub you've  = you have
  ! sub you'll  = you will
  ! sub what's  = what is
  ! sub whats   = what is
  ! sub what're = what are
  ! sub what've = what have
  ! sub what'll = what will</pre>
<p>Save this as <code>begin.rs</code> in your project directory. Now, for an explanation on
what this code is doing.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="definitions">Definitions</a></h3>
<p>You've already seen the <code>!</code> command used for the version line, but what are all
these other lines? More generally, the <code>!</code> command is used for <strong>Definitions</strong>
(just like the <code>+</code> is for <strong>Triggers</strong> and the <code>-</code> is for <strong>Replies</strong>). In the
version line, we are <em>defining</em> that the version is 2.0.</p>
<p>Also, you may be wondering what the <code>//</code> characters are for. Like in most
programming languages, RiveScript allows you to include <strong>Comments</strong> in your
source code. The <code>//</code> characters denote the start of a comment. The interpreter
will ignore these comments when it reads your code; they're only there for the
humans (you!) who have to read and maintain the code.</p>
<p>Now let's go over these new definition types.</p>
<p>First, we defined a couple of <strong>Bot Variables</strong>. These are pieces of information
that describe your bot, such as its name and age in this example. These will
come in handy later. With bot variables, we can write replies in which the bot
can tell the user a little something about itself.</p>
<p>Then, we defined a handful of <strong>Substitutions</strong>. Substitutions are
<em>always lowercased</em>. On the left side of the = sign, you write the &quot;original
text&quot; that may appear in the user's message, and on the right you place the
substituted text. The text on the right <em>should not</em> contain any special
symbols or punctuation, and it should also be lowercased.</p>
<p>With these substitutions, if a user says to the bot, &quot;what's up?&quot; or
&quot;I've been at work all day&quot;, the RiveScript interpreter will expand these
messages out to &quot;what is up&quot; and &quot;i have been at work all day&quot;, respectively,
before it starts looking for a reply.</p>
<p>Here is some more code that you can add to your <code>hello.rs</code> file from earlier
that demonstrates how substitutions work:</p>
<pre>
  + what is up
  - Not much, you?
  - nm, you?
  - Not a lot, you?</pre>
<pre>
  + you are a bot
  - How did you know I'm a machine?</pre>
<p>You can then ask your bot, &quot;What's up?&quot; or &quot;You're a bot&quot; and see that it
matches these replies accordingly. Notice that the substitutions didn't
apply to the bot's response to &quot;you're a bot&quot; -- it says &quot;How did you know
I'm a machine?&quot; -- substitutions only apply to the user's
incoming message. They're also used with the <code>% Previous</code> command, but
we'll get to that later.</p>
<p>There are other types of definition commands available too: <code>array</code>,
<code>global</code>, and <code>person</code>. These are useful for more advanced replies and
they'll be covered later in this tutorial.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> there will be many more examples of RiveScript code in this
tutorial. You can put these in any RiveScript document you wish; you can
create a new <code>.rs</code> file for them if you like. Now and then I'll mention
a recommended file name, though, but the names don't really matter that
much.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="open_ended_triggers">Open-Ended Triggers</a></h2>
<p>So far, the triggers you've seen have been what I call &quot;atomic&quot; -- they
describe a user's message <em>perfectly</em>. For example, the user must say
exactly &quot;hello bot&quot;; they can't say &quot;hello there&quot; or &quot;hello mang&quot; and
still match one of your triggers, unless you've written individual triggers
for each possible thing they could say!</p>
<p>This is where <strong>Wildcards</strong> come into play. With wildcards, you can mark
a part of the trigger as being open-ended. The best way to demonstrate
this is with an example:</p>
<pre>
  + my name is *
  - Nice to meet you, &lt;star1&gt;!</pre>
<pre>
  + * told me to say *
  - Why would &lt;star1&gt; tell you to say &quot;&lt;star2&gt;&quot;?
  - Did you say &quot;&lt;star2&gt;&quot; after &lt;star1&gt; told you to?</pre>
<pre>
  + i am * years old
  - A lot of people are &lt;star1&gt; years old.</pre>
<p>With these triggers, a user can say &quot;My name is Noah&quot;, or &quot;I am 24 years
old&quot;, and the bot will be able to match these messages all the same.
Wildcards are very useful to match messages that may contain &quot;variable&quot;
data, such as names or numbers. They're also useful for your bot to be
able to fake knowledge about a subject:</p>
<pre>
  + where is *
  - Where it belongs.
  - Where you left it.
  - Where the heart is.</pre>
<p>You can write triggers for common questions like &quot;who is&quot;, &quot;where is&quot;,
and &quot;what is&quot; by using wildcards; so, if the user asks your bot about
something that your bot doesn't have a special trigger to handle, it
can give a sort of &quot;generic&quot; response that will be at least somewhat
relevant to the question.</p>
<p>You may have noticed the <code>&lt;star1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;star2&gt;</code>
tags that appeared in some of those replies up there. These tags can
be used in a reply in order to repeat the words matched by the wildcards.
When the user says &quot;my name is Noah&quot;, the first wildcard in that trigger
would catch the name, and <code>&lt;star1&gt;</code> would be &quot;noah&quot; in this
case.</p>
<p>If you only have a single wildcard, you may just use the <code>&lt;star&gt;</code>
tag without the number &quot;1&quot; as a shortcut:</p>
<pre>
  + who is *
  - I don't know who &lt;star&gt; is.</pre>
<p>While we're on the topic of wildcards...</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="catch_all_trigger">Catch-All Trigger</a></h3>
<p>Remember back in <a href="#hello__human_">Hello, Human!</a> where the bot would say &quot;ERR: No Reply
Matched&quot; whenever we said something it couldn't reply to? Well, we can
remedy this by writing a catch-all trigger.</p>
<p>A catch-all trigger is one that simply consists of a single wildcard:</p>
<pre>
  + *
  - I'm not sure how to reply to that.
  - Try asking your question a different way.
  - Let's change the subject.</pre>
<p>Anything the user says now that doesn't get matched by a more relevant
trigger will fall back to the <code>*</code> trigger. This way, you can avoid letting
the bot say &quot;ERR: No Reply Matched&quot;, and use it to try to steer the
conversation back on track.</p>
<p>Conventionally, your catch-all trigger should go into a file named
<code>star.rs</code>, so that when you're looking for it later to make changes
you'll know exactly where you put it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="specialized_wildcards">Specialized Wildcards</a></h3>
<p>Wildcards are great, but what if you want to restrict what a wildcard is
allowed to match? For example, the trigger &quot;i am * years old&quot; would match
a message like &quot;I am twenty four years old&quot; just as well as &quot;I am 24 years
old&quot;.</p>
<p>There are two other wildcard symbols you may use. The <code>#</code> symbol is a wildcard
that will <em>only</em> match a number. The <code>_</code> symbol is one that will <em>only</em> match
a word with no numbers or spaces in it.</p>
<p>You can have multiple triggers that look the same but use different wildcards
and they will work how you'd expect:</p>
<pre>
  + i am # years old
  - A lot of people are &lt;star&gt; years old.</pre>
<pre>
  + i am _ years old
  - Tell me that again but with a number this time.</pre>
<pre>
  + i am * years old
  - Can you use a number instead?</pre>
<p>Regardless of the type of wildcard you use, you can use the <code>&lt;star&gt;</code>
tags to pull them into the reply.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="alternatives_and_optionals">Alternatives and Optionals</a></h2>
<p>What if you want to use something like a wildcard, but you want to limit the
possible words to a select few? This is where optionals come into play.</p>
<p>The syntax for these is a little tricky. Let's start with some examples:</p>
<pre>
  + what is your (home|office|cell) number
  - You can reach me at: 1 (800) 555-1234.</pre>
<pre>
  + i am (really|very|super) tired
  - I'm sorry to hear that you are &lt;star&gt; tired.</pre>
<pre>
  + i (like|love) the color *
  - What a coincidence! I &lt;star1&gt; that color too!
  - I also have a soft spot for the color &lt;star2&gt;!
  - Really? I &lt;star1&gt; the color &lt;star2&gt; too!
  - Oh I &lt;star1&gt; &lt;star2&gt; too!</pre>
<p>In these examples, a user can say &quot;what is your home number&quot;, or &quot;what is
your office number&quot;, or &quot;what is your cell number&quot; and match the first
trigger. Or they can say &quot;I am really tired&quot;, &quot;I am very tired&quot;, or &quot;I am
super tired&quot; and match the second one. And so on. But, if the user says
&quot;I am extremely tired&quot;, it won't match because &quot;extremely&quot; wasn't listed
in the alternatives!</p>
<p>The alternative that the user used in their message can be captured with
a <code>&lt;star&gt;</code> tag too, just like wildcards. Alternatives don't have
to be single words, either.</p>
<pre>
  + i (will|will not) *
  - It doesn't matter to me whether you &lt;star2&gt; or not.</pre>
<p>Optionals are like alternatives, but they don't <em>need</em> to be present in
the user's message <em>at all!</em> But, if the user does say them, it will help
match the reply anyway.</p>
<pre>
  + how [are] you
  - I'm great, you?</pre>
<pre>
  + what is your (home|office|cell) [phone] number
  - You can reach me at: 1 (800) 555-1234.</pre>
<pre>
  + i have a [red|green|blue] car
  - I bet you like your car a lot.</pre>
<p>Since optionals don't have to be present in the user's message, they
<em>can not</em> be captured with <code>&lt;star&gt;</code> tags. If you had a wildcard
or optional before and after an optional, <code>&lt;star1&gt;</code> would be the
first wildcard or optional, and <code>&lt;star2&gt;</code> would be the second; the
optional would be skipped.</p>
<p>

<h2><a name="arrays_in_triggers">Arrays in Triggers</a></h2>
<p>Consider something a human might say to a bot: &quot;what color is my blue shirt?&quot;
You might be able to program a reply to this using wildcards, but alternatives
would be even better, since you can limit the color to a small set.</p>
<pre>
  + what color is my (red|blue|green|yellow) *
  - Your &lt;star2&gt; is &lt;star1&gt;, silly!</pre>
<p>Wouldn't it be useful to re-use this list of colors for other triggers without
having to copy and paste it all over the place? Well, that's exactly the reason
why <strong>Arrays</strong> exist! In RiveScript, you can make a list of words or phrases,
give that list a name, and then use it in a trigger (or multiple triggers!)</p>
<p>You define an array using the <code>! array</code> command, which was first mentioned
in the <a href="#definitions">Definitions</a>. By convention, all definitions belong in <code>begin.rs</code>,
so write the following code in <code>begin.rs</code>!</p>
<pre>
  ! array colors = red blue green yellow</pre>
<p>Now, you can refer to this array by name in your triggers. Here are a couple
examples you can use (you can use arrays in as many triggers as you want):</p>
<pre>
  + what color is my (@colors) *
  - Your &lt;star2&gt; is &lt;star1&gt;, silly!
  - Do I look dumb to you? It's &lt;star1&gt;!</pre>
<pre>
  + i am wearing a (@colors) shirt
  - Do you really like &lt;star&gt;?</pre>
<p>Just like wildcards and alternatives, the word the user used out of the array
can be captured in a <code>&lt;star&gt;</code> tag. If you don't want this to happen,
you can use the array without the parenthesis around it:</p>
<pre>
  // Without parenthesis, the array doesn't go into a &lt;star&gt; tag.
  + what color is my @colors *
  - I don't know what color your &lt;star&gt; is.</pre>
<p>Arrays can be used in optionals too. They don't go into <code>&lt;star&gt;</code> tags
though, because optionals <em>never</em> do!</p>
<pre>
  // Arrays in an optional
  - i just bought a [@colors] *
  - Is that your first &lt;star&gt;?</pre>
<p>

<h2><a name="priority_triggers">Priority Triggers</a></h2>
<p>You're almost done learning about all the things that can be done to a trigger!</p>
<p>The last thing is weighted, or priority triggers. You've seen the <code>{weight}</code>
tag applied to responses before. Well, the same tag can also be used in a
trigger!</p>
<p>A weighted trigger has a higher matching priority than others. This is useful
to &quot;hand tune&quot; how well a trigger matches the user's message. An example of
this would be, suppose you have the following two triggers:</p>
<pre>
  + google *
  - Google search: &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://google.com/search?q=&lt;star&gt;">http://google.com/search?q=&lt;star&gt;</a>&quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<pre>
  + * perl script
  - You need Perl to run a Perl script.</pre>
<p>What if somebody asked the bot, &quot;google write perl script&quot;? They might expect
the bot to provide them with a Google search link, but instead the bot replies
talking about needing Perl. This is because &quot;* perl script&quot; has more words than
&quot;google *&quot;, and therefore would usually be a better match.</p>
<p>We can add a <code>{weight}</code> tag to the Google trigger to make that trigger &quot;more
important&quot; than anything with a lower weight.</p>
<pre>
  + google *{weight=10}
  - Google search: &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://google.com/search?q=&lt;star&gt;">http://google.com/search?q=&lt;star&gt;</a>&quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<pre>
  + * perl script
  - You need Perl to run a Perl script.</pre>
<p>Now, if the user starts their message with &quot;google&quot;, that trigger will have the
highest priority for matching than anything else. The weights on triggers are
arbitrary, and higher numbers just mean it has a higher priority than ones with
lower numbers. Triggers that don't have a <code>{weight}</code> tag automatically have a
weight of 1.</p>
<p>You can't have a zero or negative weight value.</p>
<p>If you have multiple triggers with the same weight value, these triggers are
considered equals, and their matching order will be the same as usual (triggers
with more words are tested first). If no triggers with a given weight can
match the user's message, then triggers with a lower weight are tried.</p>
<p>See the &quot;Sorting +Triggers&quot; section of the RiveScript Working Draft for a
detailed explanation of how triggers are sorted.</p>

<h3><a name="command_prompt_help">Command Prompt Help</a></h3>
<p>If you're not familiar with DOS commands and how to change directories in a
command prompt window, you should look up a quick tutorial on how to use the
command line. One such tutorial can be found at
<a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm">http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm</a></p>
<p>For the lazy, you can create a simple batch file and place it in the same folder
as the RiveScript interpreter that would open a command prompt window there,
without needing to <code>cd</code> to that folder yourself.</p>
<p>Open Notepad and type the following code into a new file:</p>
<pre>
  @echo off
  cmd</pre>
<p>Save the file as <code>&quot;cmd.bat&quot;</code> (<em>with</em> the quotation marks!) in the same folder
as the <code>rivescript</code> file from the Perl RiveScript distribution. Now, navigate
to that folder in Windows Explorer and double-click on the <code>cmd.bat</code> file
(the file might appear as simply &quot;<code>cmd</code>&quot; if file extensions are hidden).</p>
